# [JSL10] Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

# Project Overview

The Escape Vanilla JS challenge is a captivating and interactive web-based project that has provided me with invaluable insights into debugging skills, problem-solving, and the concept of abstraction in JavaScript. The project is designed as an adventurous journey through three distinct "rooms," each posing a unique challenge that demands the application of debugging techniques to correct given JavaScript code in order to progress. This immersive experience has not only honed my debugging abilities but also enhanced my problem-solving skills as I navigate through the intricacies of the challenges presented in each room.

## Debugging Steps Taken

1. **Correct the ID used in the event listener for Room 1.**
2. **Use the correct element ID when displaying results for Room 1.**
3. **Add the missing 'async' keyword to the JS concepts set.**
4. **Correct the function call to find the intersection of `jsConcepts` and `reactConcepts` for Room 2.**
5. **Ensure asynchronous operations are handled correctly in Room 3, particularly by adding `await` before the promise in `navigateLabyrinth`.**
6. **Adjust the `findMostRecentBook` function to correctly compare dates and find the most recent book.**
7. **Fix the `findIntersection` function to correctly determine the intersection of two sets.**
8. **Add the `await` keyword before `new Promise` in `navigateLabyrinth` to ensure the simulation of asynchronous operations works as intended.**

# Added Improvements
I've added a loading spinner for the Asynchronous function of displaying the directions, so when the button is click the loading spinner will appear and then load until the directions in navigateLabyrinth loading, then the loading spinner will disappear and the directions of Ladyrinth will appear.

# ðŸ“š What I learned

I have learned to unravel complex coding issues, identify errors, and implement effective debugging strategies to overcome obstacles. Moreover, the concept of abstraction has been exemplified in the way the challenges are structured, encouraging me to distill intricate programming problems into manageable and comprehensible components.
